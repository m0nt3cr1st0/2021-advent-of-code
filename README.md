# What is this for?

It is where I keep my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) solutions!

# Some notes for future Gonzalo #

Input retrieval is done through [advent-of-code-data Python Package](https://pypi.org/project/advent-of-code-data/)

```
>>> from aocd import data
'39402394394...'
```

Same as for submission
```
>>> from aocd import submit
submit(my_answer, part="a", day=25, year=2017)
```

That's all! Enjoy!
